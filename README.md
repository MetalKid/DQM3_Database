# DQM3_Database
Data for Dragon Quest Monsters 3: The Dark Prince

This repository will have JSON files of all the tables as the data gets created. At the end, a SQL Server mdb file will also be uploaded. If you want another data format
of this data, let me know and I'll see what I can do!

If you use this data, all I ask is that you share that you got it from here!

The website that will show this database data is up. The Monsterpedia, Skills, Traits, Talents, Calculators, etc. are all op. The Monsterpedia Details also includes all the Synthesis tree data
in a sort of org chart style that shows the full family tree of each monster.
